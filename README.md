##ABSTRACT
In this project, we addressed challenges in a nut and bolt manufacturing factory by implementing sustainable energy solutions and advanced sensor technologies. We installed solar panels to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy and lower costs. Smart sensors, including LDRs for automated lighting, thermostats for temperature control, and MQ2 gas sensors for smoke detection, enhanced energy efficiency and workplace safety. These innovations created a safer, more comfortable, and eco-friendly environment, showcasing a scalable model for improving industrial working conditions and promoting sustainability.
